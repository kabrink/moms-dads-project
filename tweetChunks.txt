New York, Houston, Memphis and Orlando all still have vacancies Sources say Golden State also has strong interest in Hornacek to join the Warriors' bench  next season if he's still on the market by then. The Knicks, league sources say, have interviewed Jeff Hornacek for their coaching job along with Kurt Rambis, David Blatt and Frank Vogel. Less than seven hours to go before the Western Conference finals tips off with the Warriors SEVENTY games over .500 at 81-11 overall. #crazy Karl-Anthony Towns ... fifth unanimously selected Rookie of the Year in NBA history Justin Zanik and Rod Higgins, sources say, are among a handful of candidates Milwaukee is looking at to work alongside Bucks GM John Hammond Milwaukee plans to interview Jazz exec Justin Zanik and ex-Charlotte GM Rod Higgins this week for a front-office post, league sources say.

@dadadopt twiddling thumbs a little here. Last summer was super busy working on a big project. Now‚Ä¶ nada! Find not working and yet not having any real focus quite frustrating and a little demoralising. Being a prospective adopter and a freelancer is really tricky. Limbo now between not able to commit to big projects and having a child. If my future child doesn't care about herb gardens and peonies, I could be in trouble. I'm not one thing blow my own trumpet but my gardening yesterday was top level. 12 points from the jury. Visit from SW gave us more questions than answers. Sigh. @lgbtadoptfoster Hi, is there a problem with your members area? I can‚Äôt get access‚Ä¶ @NowWeAreSix it would be so hard to leave our beloved home city but think it might be better in long run.

I should get an hour later to nap on the couch. Not because the house will be quiet, but when I go, there will be no waking me. At least I'm off today. We made it home just after 3am. Guess who was up at 6? By then the kids were asleep in the back. The drive in staff came by with a booster box, and eventually I managed to get it started. All of this at 2am, in an empty lot at the drive in on a cold May night. As I searched the trunk for jumper cables, the tailgate dropped on my back. "
